# AI Agent Software Engineering Philosophy

This repository is dedicated to exploring and implementing a fundamental philosophy for software engineering in the era of Multi-Agent Software Engineering (Multi SWE Agent).

## Core Philosophy

This skill is developed based on the following philosophy:

> In the era of Multi-Agent Software Engineering (Multi SWE Agent), given fixed model capabilities, "infinite tokens" equates to "infinite human resources." The guiding first principle for all design patterns should be to "enable a large number of diverse agents to collaborate effectively in coding," rather than "relying on a single genius agent to develop haphazardly." To achieve "collaboration among a large number of agents," it is imperative to strictly adhere to all established human software engineering management practices:
>
> 1.  **Strict Adherence to Top-Down Design**: First, write the specification (Spec); then, select the technology stack (Tech Stack); next, complete the design; then, design the modules; finally, allocate and complete the coding.
> 2.  **Code as "Disposable Artifacts," Discard After Use**: If a codebase is repeatedly modified, it will inevitably become an "unmaintainable codebase with high technical debt," rendering it unmanageable after numerous sprints. However, if code is treated as a disposable artifact, with every modification starting from a spec update and leading to a complete rewrite—fixing endpoints and functionalities, and rewriting repeatedly—then technical debt will not accumulate.
> 3.  **Extensive, Massive, and Comprehensive Unit Tests to Ensure Stability**: Utilize a vast and comprehensive array of unit tests to guarantee the stability of the entire codebase and the consistency of APIs, endpoints, and other components. Given an abundance of general-purpose coding agents, a similar number of dedicated Software Development Engineer in Test (SDE Test Agents) should be employed to handle testing exclusively.
>
> All human experience in software development is encapsulated within the discipline of software engineering. This discipline teaches us one singular truth: how to effectively manage, guide, and allocate work to capable agents. In today's era of "infinite tokens" equating to "infinite human resources," software engineering stands as the supreme management bible. Only by thoroughly grasping the essence of software engineering can one transition from the mindset of "using a single genius LLM Agent for coding" to "effectively managing 1000 fallible yet continuously learning LLM Agents for collaborative coding."
